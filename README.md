 PyTorch Learning Journey

Welcome to my PyTorch learning repository! This repository contains the codes, concepts, and examples I have explored as I learn PyTorch. The purpose of this repository is to document my progress and serve as a resource for anyone who wants to learn PyTorch basics and beyond.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

### 1. **Introduction to PyTorch**
- Setting up PyTorch with GPU support.
- Basic tensor operations.

### 2. **Dataset Handling**
- Using `torch.utils.data.Dataset` and `DataLoader` to create custom datasets.

### 3. **Building Neural Networks**
- Creating simple Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) using `torch.nn.Module`.
- Training and evaluating models with GPU acceleration.

### 4. **Techniques to Reduce Overfitting**
- Adding dropouts to neural networks.
- Using batch normalization.
- Implementing regularization (L2 regularization).

### 5. **Model Training and Evaluation**
- Training neural networks using optimizers like SGD and Adam.
- Implementing custom training loops.
- Evaluating accuracy and performance.

## Key Concepts and Techniques Explored
